# About project
In this smaller project I started to develop an budget tracking app, primarily targeting students with limited resources that need to closly monitor and manage their budgets. The app is build in react native using expo as a framework for compiling and pushing the app to the device.

The app is only tested in android, as that is the phone I have. It should theoretically work for iPhone as well.

# Getting up and running.
To run this project you will need npm/yarn, react native and an android phone with the expo app installed.

Running the development version of the app:
```sh
$ yarn run android
```

To build an application binary you will need an account with expo and run the following command after regestering:
```sh
$ exp build:android
```
